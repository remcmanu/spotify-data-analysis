# spotify-data-analysis
Tools to analyze personal Spotify data. (I'm also storing my data here, which is probably not useful for anyone else)

## To Use

1. Place `spotify.py` into the "MyData" directory Spotify provides upon request. 

2. Rename the streaming history files (I usually only have at max two of them (0 and 1)) to historyN, where N starts at 0. 

3. Remove duplicate entries from between the different files. I'll briefly describe how I did this: Given I had two data requests each with two files, I found the last element of the first download (located in `history1`)
```
  {
    "endTime" : "2021-02-04 19:02",
    "artistName" : "Ang√®le",
    "trackName" : "Ta reine",
    "msPlayed" : 38160
  }
```
I found this same entry in `history2`, and deleted it and everything that came before it.

4. If running `spotify.py` directly, change `count` to be equal to the number of files you have.

## Functions
